################ Configuration file for one ADS1256 instance  #################
# SPI bus configuration and GPIO pins used for the ADS1255/ADS1256.
#
# These settings are for the Isoflux hardware which has two ADS1256 devices
# sharing the Raspberry Pi primary SPI bus.
#
# This is the config for the second of the two ADS1256 devices..

#LOGLEVEL = logging.WARNING
LOGLEVEL = logging.DEBUG

# 0 for main SPI bus, 1 for auxiliary SPI bus.
SPI_BUS = 0
# SPI clock rate in Hz. The ADS1256 supports a minimum of 1/10th of the output
# sample data rate in Hz to 1/4th of the oscillator CLKIN_FREQUENCY which
# results in a value of 1920000 Hz for the Waveshare board. However, since
# the Raspberry pi only supports power-of-two fractions of the 250MHz system
# clock, the closest value would be 1953125 Hz, which is slightly out of spec
# for the ADS1256. Choosing 250MHz/256 = 976563 Hz is a safe choice.
#SPI_FREQUENCY = 976563
SPI_FREQUENCY = 976563
# Risking the slightly out-of-spec speed:
#SPI_FREQUENCY = 1953125
# If set to True this will perform a chip reset using the hardware reset line
# when initializing the device.

#### Raspberry Pi GPIO configuration ##########################################
# =====> NEW in version 2 since using pigpio instead of wiringpi library:
# =====> Raspberry Pi pinning now uses the Broadcom numbering scheme!
#
# Tuple of all (chip select) GPIO numbers to be configured as an output and
# initialised to (inactive) logic high state before bus communication starts.
# Necessary for more than one SPI device if GPIOs are not otherwise handled.
#CHIP_SELECT_GPIOS_INITIALIZE = (7, 8)
CHIP_SELECT_GPIOS_INITIALIZE = (7, 8)
# Chip select GPIO pin number.
# This is required as hardware chip select can not be used with the ADS125x
# devices using this library
#CS_PIN      = 8 # CH0
CS_PIN      = 7 # CH1
# If DRDY is not connected to an input, a sufficient DRDY_TIMEOUT must be
# specified further below and aquisition will be slower.
#DRDY_PIN    = 5 # CH0
DRDY_PIN    = 6 # CH1
# Hardware reset pin is optional but strongly suggested in case multiple devices
# are connected to the bus as the ADS125x will lock-up in case multiple chips
# are selected simultaneously by accident.
RESET_PIN   = 3 # Set to None if not used.
# Optional power down pin
PDWN_PIN    = 2 # Set to None if not used.

# sample rate of 2.5 SPS and issuing a self calibration command,
# the timeout can be up to 1228 milliseconds:
DRDY_TIMEOUT    = 2
# Optional delay in seconds to avoid busy wait and reduce CPU load when
# polling the DRDY pin. Default is 0.000001 or 1 Âµs (timing not accurate)

# REG_STATUS:
# When enabling the AUTOCAL flag: Any following operation that changes
