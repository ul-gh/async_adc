"""Configuration file for ADS1256.

SPI bus configuration and GPIO pins used for the ADS1255/ADS1256.

These settings are compatible with the "Waveshare High-Precision AD/DA" board.

To create multiple class instances for more than one AD converter, a unique
configuration must be specified for each instance.
